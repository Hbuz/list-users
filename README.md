# List Users

## Small React application that list users using Redux

### Main functionalities:
* Show user details by click on them
* Edit user details in the user details page
* Delete a user in the user details page
* Add new users using the form in the main page


For this project I used [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to expose a REST API based on a JSON file.
In this way you can do create, update and delete statements and you will be able to see the changes in the JSON file

Data are stored in: db.json

To install JSON-server: ```$ npm install json-server```
